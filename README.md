## past

**The history analysis command for Unix-like shells** (sorry PowerShell fans).

The goal of `past` is to be modern take on the `history` command - allowing you to see usage patterns, trends, and generally look back on your command history in a feature rich way. Currently features include:

- Summary statistics of your command usage (`--brief or --detailed`)
- Category-based search (`-C/--category`)
- Keyword search (`-s/--search`)
- Interactive search mode (`-i/--interactive`)

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/KaylBing/past
cd past
cargo build --release

# Aliasing (until we are approved for brew and apt)
# The cleanest way to use our command for now, is to add something like this to your .bashrc

alias past='/path/to/repo/past/target/release/past'
