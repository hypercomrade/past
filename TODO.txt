Session Search (add timestamps to commands in the hist file)

Fix -i search bar not filling

Better github runners (not sure how to test those)

Estimate runtimes and scalability of current commands (probably bad), may want to switch to a binary search tree at some point

Consider an actual database for common commands

Add that past works over ssh fine, and that it supports Rocky Linux
